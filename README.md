<h1>☢️ Atomize Alias Conflicts ☢️</h1>
</br>
<p>Are you done getting error messages and warnings from your AD because some users have clonflicts between their aliases ? Well, I did, and don't want you to live the same. Here's a script to sleep peacefully and brag about at your IT coffee break.</p>
</br>
<h2>⚠️  Before executing it</h2>
</br>
<p>Just download the file, launch it from your AD with admin privileges (trust me u won't regret it) and enjoy fixing it once and for all (you might want to restart your AD Synch Service after that, simply type services.msc after a jolly Windows+R, look up for Azure Synch Services and right click restart on this bad boy).</p>
